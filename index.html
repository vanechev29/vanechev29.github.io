    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student in geography at University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests
        range between spatial optimization models applied to wildﬁre treatment to the use of graph theory to
        detect patterns and links between the production structure of countries and poverty. I studied economics
        in Universidad Eaﬁt with emphasis in quantitative economics. At that stage, I started developing my
        skills integrating theoretical economics with technical tools, which was reﬂected in my work as research
        assistant. In addition, I have a master degree in Mathematical modeling and computing science in Uni-
        versidad de Medellín, where my graduate thesis focused in network theory, economic complexity and
        clustering analysis applied to the study of poverty in Colombian municipalities. I also worked for ﬁve
        years in Bancolombia SA as an analyst in various activities including earnings, expenses and costs analysis,
        and, algorithm design for the Eﬃciency Hub.
